# Brief: 
This program captures each frame from the computer camera and performs cascade classfication on each frame to identify a human face. In this case a human face is the Region Of Interest (ROI). It finds the ROI centre and finds the x and y axis displacement of the object centre from the frame centre.  

# Cascade Classifier: 
Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.
